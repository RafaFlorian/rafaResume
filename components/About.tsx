            My process begins with deep ingestionâ€”of project requirements, of complex business logic, of the very nature of the data itself. I thrive on understanding the 'why' behind the data points, which allows me to architect systems that are not just technically sound, but contextually aware.

            This foundational stage is about more than just moving bytes. It's about establishing a clean, reliable source of truth that fuels every subsequent step of the journey towards insight.
