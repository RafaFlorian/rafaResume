    *   **Cloud (GCP):** BigQuery, Dataflow
    *   **Orchestration & DevOps:** Airflow, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform
*   **03_ENRICHMENT (Case Studies):** These are projects where data is enriched to create value.
    1.  **Real-Time Analytics Pipeline:** Built a streaming pipeline with Kafka, Spark, and AWS Kinesis for real-time dashboards.
    2.  **Cloud Data Warehouse Migration:** Migrated a 10TB warehouse to Google BigQuery, drastically improving performance.
    3.  **AWS Datalake Architecture:** Designed a scalable data lake using S3, Glue, and Athena.
    4.  **Workflow Orchestration Modernization:** Upgraded legacy jobs to a modern system with Airflow and Docker.
*   **04_STREAM INSIGHTS (Blog):** This is where John shares his knowledge.
    *   **Post 1: "The Art of Scalable Data Pipelines":** Discusses best practices for building future-proof data systems.
    *   **Post 2: "From Batch to Real-Time: A Paradigm Shift":** A case study on transitioning an analytics platform to streaming.
    *   **Post 3: "Data Quality as a First-Class Citizen":** Explores strategies for implementing robust data validation and monitoring.
*   **05_ENDPOINT (Contact):** This is the call to action for users to connect with John about new opportunities.
